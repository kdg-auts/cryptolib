# Source Code for CDPCIS course labs
## Disclaimer
This repository contains code on Python and VHDL for some most popular cryptographic algorithms. These implementations are used as demo and explanatory materials in "Cryptographic Data Protection for Computer-Integrated Systems" (CDPCIS) university course. They are not suited for any practical use.

## Description
Folder "primitive ciphers" contains Python implementations for Caesar and Vigen√®re Ciphers. Folders with prefix "py_" contain software implementations and folders with prefix "hw_" -- VHDL descriptions of corresponding cryptographic algorithms. SW-versions can be used as test pattern generators for debugging HW-versions of cipher implementations.
